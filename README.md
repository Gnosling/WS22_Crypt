# Implementation of Kerma Project: Tasks

## Submission by Adrian Schmitt (11809936)

### Info
This project was implemendet in Java (Version 11), build by Maven and is hosted under 139.59.159.65:18018. 
There is also a complied .jar in the target folder, it only expects the "peers.txt", "objects.txt" and "utxos.txt" files in the same directory to store data.
Right now everything is empty, meaning the node has no peers, no objects and no UTXOs.

The project can be started with the "run.sh" file, if the premisses above are fulfilled.
